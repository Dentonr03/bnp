# Bits 'N Pieces

Bits 'N Pieces (BNP) is a terminal-based game in which players crack ciphers and programming puzzles, uncovering clues that reveal pieces of passphrases needed to proceed to other levels (rooms). These rooms contain different challenges (exhibits) that expose players to various components of Computer Science, allowing them to accumulate points upon completion.
